![CSS Diner Completion](./css-diner-completion.png)

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed all 28 levels of **Grid Garden**, a fun and interactive game to practise CSS grids  ðŸŽ‰

## What is Grid Garden? 
Grid Garden is an interactive game that teaches the basics of CSS Grid layout by planting carrots and watering weeds. ðŸ¥•ðŸŒ±

## Key Takeaways:
- Mastered CSS Grid properties like `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-area`, and more.
- Learned to create responsive and flexible layouts using `fr` units and `repeat()` functions.
- Gained hands-on experience with practical use cases for CSS Grid.
